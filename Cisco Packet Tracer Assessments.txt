#Cisco Packet Tracer Assessments:
There are two types of assessment items that take advantage of Packet Tracer. These include Packet Tracer Media Objects (PTMO) and Packet Tracer Skills Assessments (PTSA). PTMOs can be either a .pkt or .pka file. A PTMO will show up inline with a question on your quiz, module exam, or some other type of graded assessment. You launch the .pkt or .pka file directly from inside the assessment. Typically, you configure the network or investigate the topology, and then answer a multiple choice assessment question or questions.

You can encounter PTSAs at a mid-point in a course or at the end of the course. PTSAs are summative skill assessments in which you demonstrate your skill by implementing the technologies that you have learned. PTSAs are standalone assessments, have their own grading engine, and the results are recorded in a course gradebook, if there is one. After completing a PTSA, you receive item level feedback for each graded component.
